**Proposed Solution: Data Archival and Retrieval for Cost Optimization in Azure**
To address the cost optimization challenge while satisfying the requirements, we propose implementing tiered storage for billing records. This solution involves:

1.**Active Tier:** Storing frequently accessed (last 3 months) records in Azure Cosmos DB.
2.**Archive Tier:** Storing rarely accessed (older than 3 months) records in Azure Blob Storage.

This approach reduces Cosmos DB storage costs while maintaining data availability and ensuring minimal latency for archival record access.

**Detailed Solution**
1. Tiered Storage
  Active Tier (Cosmos DB):
    Stores records less than three months old for high-performance reads.
    Ideal for read-heavy workloads with low latency.
  Archive Tier (Blob Storage):
    Stores records older than three months in a compressed format to minimize storage costs.
    Data is accessed on demand via the API, ensuring no changes to API contracts.
2. Archival Process
  Trigger-Based Archival:
    A timer-based Azure Function periodically scans Cosmos DB for records older than three months.
    These records are compressed and moved to Azure Blob Storage.
    A metadata file (e.g., JSON) is maintained in Blob Storage to index archived records for efficient retrieval.
3. Retrieval Process
  Unified API:
  The same API handles requests for both active and archived data.
  If a record older than 3 months is requested, the API fetches it from Blob Storage with minimal latency.
  This ensures seamless integration without breaking existing contracts.
4. Compression for Cost Optimization
  Records archived in Blob Storage are compressed using formats like gzip to further reduce storage costs.
5. High Availability
  Both Cosmos DB and Blob Storage are highly available services in Azure. Proper retries and failover mechanisms ensure robust performance.
6. Deployment and Maintenance
  The system is deployed using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Terraform.
  Minimal downtime is ensured through rolling updates.

**Rationale**
1.Cost Optimization:
  Archiving records to Blob Storage reduces Cosmos DB storage costs significantly.
  Compression further minimizes Blob Storage costs.

2.Data Availability:
  Archived records are accessible via Blob Storage with minimal latency.

3.Seamless Integration:
  Unified API ensures no changes to existing contracts.

4.Ease of Deployment:
  Terraform and Azure CLI enable automated deployment with no downtime.

5.Robustness:
  High availability of Cosmos DB and Blob Storage ensures resilience.
  Retry mechanisms prevent data loss during failures.

**Final Notes:**
This proposed solution is robust, scalable, and production-grade. It meets the requirements of cost optimization, no data loss, and seamless API integration while ensuring high availability and performance.
